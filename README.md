Dear Polixis team, thank you for considering me, below I present my project.
Since the task was as follows - write a service that receives JSON messages from Kafka, 
write it to the database, I approached from the point of view of microservices architecture.
I realized a little event driven
+ CQRS, where upon receipt of a letter, a service sends a letter through a broker (Apache Kafka)
to another service and accordingly stores it in the database.

Language : Java 
Framework : Spring 
Database : MySQL
Message Broker : Kafka
Api Testing : Postman
I am attaching pictures showing the correct operation of the project (logs, db column)â€¤
